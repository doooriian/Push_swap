## ‚ú® Overview

**Push_swap** is an individual project at 42 School that challenges students to sort a stack of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The objective is to achieve a fully sorted stack in the fewest moves possible, emphasizing algorithm optimization and efficient stack manipulation.

For this project, I implemented the **Turkish algorithm**, a proven strategy for solving Push_swap efficiently, inspired by [this resource](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97) from its creator. To meet the bonus requirements‚Äîwhich demand sorting within an even stricter move limit‚ÄîI optimized the algorithm by checking if both numbers to be moved are above or below the median. This allowed me to perform simultaneous rotations (e.g., `rr` or `rrr`) when possible, reducing the total number of moves.

## üìë Key Features

- **Sorting Algorithm**: Utilizes the Turkish algorithm for optimal stack sorting.
- **Operations**: Implements all required stack operations:
  - `sa`, `sb`, `ss` ‚Äî Swap the top two elements of stack A, B, or both.
  - `pa`, `pb` ‚Äî Push an element from stack A to B or vice versa.
  - `ra`, `rb`, `rr` ‚Äî Rotate stack A, B, or both upward.
  - `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr` ‚Äî Reverse rotate stack A, B, or both downward.
- **Optimization**: Enhanced the Turkish algorithm to perform simultaneous rotations when both numbers are on the same side of the median, minimizing move count.
- **Bonus Achievement**: Meets the bonus criteria by staying below the required move threshold.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

## üöÄ How to Build and Run

Clone the repository and use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Compile the project
make all

# Remove object files
make clean

# Remove object files and executable
make fclean

# Clean and recompile
make re

```

## üöÄ How to Run the Program

To run the program, provide a list of integers as arguments:

```bash
./push_swap 3 1 4 2

```
## üß™ Testing

The implementation was thoroughly tested using the following tools:

- [**Push_swap Visualizer**](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer)
  : A tool that allows step-by-step visualization of the sorting process.
- [**Push_swap Tester**](https://gitlab.com/nda-cunh/push_swap-testeur-max)
  : A combined visualizer and tester to verify both correctness and efficiency of moves.

Additionally, custom test cases were created to check edge cases and ensure compliance with bonus requirements.

## üì∏ Visual Example

[Insert a visual example here, such as a screenshot or GIF showing the sorting process.]

### How to Add a Visual Example:
To include a visual in your project:
1. Capture a screenshot or record a GIF using tools like [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) (Windows) or [Kap](https://getkap.co/) (macOS) while running the Push_swap Visualizer.
2. Upload the file (e.g., `sorting.gif`) to your GitHub repository, ideally in a folder like `assets/`.
3. Replace this placeholder with the following Markdown code:
4. 
   ![Sorting Process]([assets/sorting.gif](https://github.com/doooriian/42-Badges/blob/main/push_swap.gif))

**Note:** Adjust the file path (`assets/sorting.gif`) to match where you stored your visual.
